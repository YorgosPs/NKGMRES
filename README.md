# NKGMRES
Implementation of Newton Krylov GMRES in Python

This is a matrix-free solver, meaning it can find roots of high-dimensional nonlinear equations, without calculating a Jacobian (or derivatives of any order). This solver can be used to locate steady states of large systems of Ordinary Differential Equations or Partial Differential Equations.
